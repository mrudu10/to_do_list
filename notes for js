1) we have to have an id wrt the up to dated changes=> Date.now()
2)get the needed element from HTML fil which is getElementById("element id name )
3) we just need the value of the objects so we are doing .value
4)check up the things by doing console.log(taskData) to see if while pressing save changes the items are getting printed or not
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                TO MAKE IT APPEAR AS A NEW CARD
5) create a newCard function that will have the exact code of html that is req to create a new card, since its multi-line, we use ``
6)to make that display  as a card on adjacent to the existing card so we create a querySelector the specifically rack tha required Id to be selected and then we use insertAdjacentHTML("beforeend",value)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                     TO CREATE A LOCAL STORAGE
7) Now we should have a local storage so as to retain the changes made on the page.
8) So creating an arr of objects which can hold the changes-globalStore
9)To insert the data into global store we use push to push the taskdata into globalStore
10) Now we have localStorage which is a keyword. 
11) we will make that array as a localstorage element and we will set all teh values into it. We cannot push the objects directly into local storage
12)we need a unique id or name our storage so as to use it.
13)Now whatever we have inserted its in objects of objects format so we will convert it into array of objects that is readable format
14)JSON.stringify((key:value));
Stringify will take an input of object of objects and will convert it into array of objects.
key can be anything jere we gave it as cards

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                    FETCH DATA STORED IN LOCAL STORAGE AND DISPLAY IT-loadInitialCard()

15) Now that we have our data stored in local storage, we will need a function to retrieve and the data from local storage
16) we have named our storage as tasky and now we want to get the items from that storage so we use getItem("tasky)
17)Now whatever we got is in array of object format coz thats how we stored it, 
now we want to convert it back to normal object which is opposite of stringify i.e parse.

18) We need to retain the content whenever we refresh the page so we give the loadInitialCard function 
to HTML body coz every time we refresh the entire body should get updated.

19)To insert the entire data of the card on the page we have to iterate through each item or element on the card so we loop over the objects of card
20) now to iterate through the objects we have to have each element separately so we are destructuring the cards and then iterate through the cards
{cards} this is destructuring of the object tasky and storing it into cards

21)now map through the de-structured object using map SYNTAX: cards.map((e)=>{console.log(e) or do required task});

22) we will create a function which will have the de-structured object as parameter. 
(this function is the edited version of new card, its just changed as a parameterized function)
23) we then have to ensure that other cards along with new added card is updated in the localstorage. so we push the entire card object into the local storage
